                Hi, we start to learn the basics of monoidal category, because it is related to categorical quantum theory, and I would like to try it. Another reason is that my life is boring and I am trying to find something intriguing to do, and make me feel that I am not useless.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let us start with the strict monoidal category. It is a tuple \(\langle B,\box,e\rangle\), where \(B\) is a category, \(\box\) is a bifunctor with domain \(B\times B\). According to the Book, we require the bifunctor \(B\) to be associative over objects, and the object \(e\) acts as a left and right unit for \(\box\). But I would prefer to write these properties in details:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - When the Book discusses associativity, it says the two functors \(\box(\box\times 1)\) and \(\box(1\times\box)\) are identical. Here, \(\box\times 1\) is a functor from \((B\times B)\times B\) to \(B\), and \(1\times\box\) is a functor from \(B\times(B\times B)\) to \(B\). The Book claims that it identifies the two domains, and I think it is reasonable. Also, the 
            associativity has two levels, on the level of objects and on the level of morphisms. On the level of objects, we have \(A\box B)\box C=A\box(B\box C)\). And this implies that we can throw the ( and ) away, and simply write it as \(A\box B\box C\). On the level of morphisms, we have: if \(f: A\rightarrow B\), \(g: C\rightarrow D\) and \(h: E\rightarrow F\) are morphisms in \(B\), 
            then it satisfies the following: \((f\box g)\box h=f\box(g\box h)\). Their dom is \(A\box C\box E\) and codomain is \(B\box D\box F\). We've explained that why we drop the parentheses.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - About the role played by \(e\). The Book claims that it is a left and right unit of \(B\), and it writes \(\box(e\times 1)=id_{B}=\box(1\times e)\). Here \(e\times 1\) is seen as a functor from \(B\) to \(B\times B\), with \(c\mapsto\langle e,c\rangle\). It can be relaxing if we verify by hand that this is really a functor, but anyway... We understand that this property is also reflected on two levels, 
            on the level of objects and on the level of morphism. On the level of objects, we have \(e\box c=c=c\box e\). On the level of morphisms, if \(f:c\rightarrow g\) is a morphism, then we have \(1_{e}\box f=f=f\box 1_{e}\). It is quite easy isn't it?
            </p>
        
            <p>
                - Finally we have to mention that \(\box\) itself is a bifunctor, so it also has to satisfy the axioms for functors. In particular, we have \(1_{a}\box 1_{b}=1_{a\box b}\) and \((f'\box g')(f\box g)=(f'f)\box (g'g)\). Here the domains are left undetermined because we all know what it means.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some straightforward examples of monoidal categories, mentioned in the Book. For example, let \(X\) be an arbitrary category, then define \(End(X)\) to be the category with objects as all endofunctors \(S:X\rightarrow X\) and morphisms are natural transformations between those endofunctors, then the \(\box\) is(on the level of objects) simply the composition of functors, i.e. \(S\box T=ST\), and it maps morphisms which are natural transformations 
                to their horizontal compositions: if \(\theta:S\rightarrow T\) and \(\theta':S'\rightarrow T'\) are two natural transformations, then \(\theta\box\theta':S\box S'\rightarrow T\box T'\) is the natural transformation from \(SS'\) to \(TT'\), and its components are \((\theta\box\theta')_{c}=...:SSc\rightarrow TT'c\). It is then straightforward to verify that such construction is really a strict monoidal category. By the way, I forget to mention the \(e\) in this 
                strict monoidal category: it is simply the functor \(id_{X}\), which is obvious.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another example is monoid. Recall a category is a monoid it has only one object. Now given a monoid, we build a corresponding strict monoidal categotry, where objects are morphisms in the monoid, and treat it as a discrete category, and the monoidal operator \(\box\) is simply the composition of morphisms in the monoid. Finally the \(e\) is the unique identical morphism in the monoid. I guess it is not hard to verify all requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now we are ready to study monoidal categories. A monoid category is a tuple \( \langle B, \box, e, \alpha, \lambda, \rho\rangle\), where \(B\) is a category, \(\box\) is a bifunctor on \(B\), \(e\) is an object in \(B\). \(\alpha\), \(\lambda\) and \(rho\) are three natural isomorphisms, correspond to associativity, left unit and right unit respectively. We discuss them three one by one.
            </p>

            <p>
                - First we consider \(\alpha\): it is a natural isomorphism from the functor \(\box(1\times\box)\) to the functor \(\box(\box\times 1)\). Write it component-wisely, for every object \(a\). \(b\) and \(c\), we have an isomorphism \(\alpha_{a,b,c}:a\box(b\box c)\rightarrow(a\box b)\box c\), which is natural. Please note that this \(\alpha\) has to satisfy another important property, say, a pentagonal diagram must commute. The pentafonal diageam starts from \( a\box(b\box(c\box d))\), 
                ends at \(((a\box b)\box c)\box d\). There are two ways to travel, one way is first go through \(\alpha\) to reach \((a\box b)\box(c\box d)\), then go through \(\alpha\) again to reach \(((a\box b)\box c)\box d\); the other way is to first go through \(1\times\alpha\) to reach \(a\box((b\box c)\box d)\), then go through \(alpha\} to reach \((a\box(b\box c)\)\box d\), finally go through \(\alpha\times 1\) to reach \(((a\box b)\box c)\box d\). This is obviously a pentagonal diagram, 
                and we require it to commute. I don't fully understand why we really need this term, but people on math stack exchange says it is important in one of Mac Lane's result on monoidal categories, where he proved that by assuming some diagrams( including this pentagonal diagram) commute, we are able to show that all large diagrams about a monoidal category commutes. It is quite amazing, and we will study this.
            </p>

            <p>
                - Second we consider \(\lambda\): it is a natural isomorphism from the functor \(\box(e\times 1)\) to \(id_{B}\)
