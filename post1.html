                Let us start with the strict monoidal category. It is a tuple \(\langle B,\box,e\rangle\), where \(B\) is a category, \(\box\) is a bifunctor with domain \(B\times B\). According to the Book, we require the bifunctor \(B\) to be associative over objects, and the object \(e\) acts as a left and right unit for \(\box\). But I would prefer to write these properties in details:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - When the Book discusses associativity, it says the two functors \(\box(\box\times 1)\) and \(\box(1\times\box)\) are identical. Here, \(\box\times 1\) is a functor from \((B\times B)\times B\) to \(B\), and \(1\times\box\) is a functor from \(B\times(B\times B)\) to \(B\). The Book claims that it identifies the two domains, and I think it is reasonable. Also, the 
            associativity has two levels, on the level of objects and on the level of morphisms. On the level of objects, we have \(A\box B)\box C=A\box(B\box C)\). And this implies that we can throw the ( and ) away, and simply write it as \(A\box B\box C\). On the level of morphisms, we have: if \(f: A\rightarrow B\), \(g: C\rightarrow D\) and \(h: E\rightarrow F\) are morphisms in \(B\), 
            then it satisfies the following: \((f\box g)\box h=f\box(g\box h)\). Their dom is \(A\box C\box E\) and codomain is \(B\box D\box F\). We've explained that why we drop the parentheses.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - About the role played by \(e\). The Book claims that it is a left and right unit of \(B\), and it writes \(\box(e\times 1)=id_{B}=\box(1\times e)\). Here \(e\times 1\) is seen as a functor from \(B\) to \(B\times B\), with \(c\mapsto\langle e,c\rangle\). It can be relaxing if we verify by hand that this is really a functor, but anyway... We understand that this property is also reflected on two levels, 
            on the level of objects and on the level of morphism. On the level of objects, we have \(e\box c=c=c\box e\). On the level of morphisms, if \(f:c\rightarrow g\) is a morphism, then we have \(1_{e}\box f=f=f\box 1_{e}\). It is quite easy isn't it?
            </p>
        
            <p>
                - Finally we have to mention that \(\box\) itself is a bifunctor, so it also has to satisfy the axioms for functors. In particular, we have \(1_{a}\box 1_{b}=1_{a\box b}\) and \((f'\box g')(f\box g)=(f'f)\box (g'g)\). Here the domains are left undetermined because we all know what it means.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some straightforward examples of monoidal categories, mentioned in the Book. For example, let \(X\) be an arbitrary category, then define \(End(X)\) to be the category with objects as all endofunctors \(S:X\rightarrow X\) and morphisms are natural transformations between those endofunctors, then the \(\box\) is(on the level of objects) simply the composition of functors, i.e. \(S\box T=ST\), and it maps morphisms which are natural transformations 
                to their horizontal compositions: if \(\theta:S\rightarrow T\) and \(\theta':S'\rightarrow T'\) are two natural transformations, then \(\theta\box\theta':S\box S'\rightarrow T\box T'\) is the natural transformation from \(SS'\) to \(TT'\), and its components are \((\theta\box\theta')_{c}=...:SSc\rightarrow TT'c\). It is then straightforward to verify that such construction is really a monoidal category.

                Another example is monoid. We can discuss this tomorrow.
