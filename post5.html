                Let us keep learning commutative algebra... Today we discuss tensor product of \(A\)-modules, where \(A\) is a ring. We may assume \(A\) is not a zero ring. We will first prove the construction of tensor product of two \(A\)-modules, and then try to understand the tensor product and monoidal categories.
            </p>

            <p>
                A classical result for tensor products is the following: Let \(M\) and \(N\) be \(A\)-modules, then there exists another \(A\)-module \(T\) and a \(A\)-bilinear map \(g:M\times N\rightarrow T\), satisfying a universal property. Here the universal property means that, for every pair \((P,f)\), where \(P\) 
                is a \(A\)-module, \(f:M\times N\rightarrow P\) is a \(A\)-bilinear map, there exists a unique \(A\)-linear map \(f':T\rightarrow P\) such that \(f'\circ g=f\).
            </p>

            <p>
                The proof is a very straightforward construction. We first introduce some basic notions. Let \(I\) be an index set, then \(A^I\) can be view as a \(A\)-module, where its elements are maps \(I\rightarrow A\) which are non-zero only on finitely many points, and the addtion and multiplication are defined 
                point-wisely. Clearly, \(A^I\) is a module generated by \(1_{x,y}\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, let \(C\) be the \(A\)-module \(A^{M\times N}\). We then define a sub-module \(D\) of \(C\), which is generated by the following elements: \(1_{x_1+x_2,y}-1_{x_1,y}-1_{x_2,y}\), \(1_{x,y_1+y_2}-1_{x,y_1}-1_{x,y_2}\), \(1_{ax,y}-a1_{x,y}\) and \(1_{x,ay}-a1_{x,y}\). We define \(T=C/D\), which 
                is clearly a \(A\)-module, and define \(g:M\times N\rightarrow T\) to be the classical quotient map composing the obvious map \(M\times N\rightarrow C\). \(g\) is bilinear for the obvious reason. We now verify the universal property. We use \(x\otimes y\) to denote the residue class of \(1_{x,y}\)
            </p>

            <p>
                For the map \(f:M\times N\rightarrow P\), we can extend linearly \(f\) to a \(\bar{f}:C\rightarrow P\), since those \(1_{x,y}\) together can be seen as a base of \(C\): every element of \(C\) has a unique set of coefficients one those \(1_{x,y}\). Then we also verify that \(\bar{f}\) vanishes on every generator 
                of \(D\), for the obvious reason. This implies that \(D\subseteq ker(\bar{f})\), then we can smoothly define a linear map \(f':T=C/D\rightarrow P\). Clearly we have \(f'\circ g=f\) for the obvious reason. The uniqueness follows from the fact that those \(x\otimes y\) generates \(T\), 
                but I am not sure whether the coefficients are unique or not, be aware. Thus we have proved the result.
            </p>

            <p>
                As it is suggested in Atiyah's commutative algebra, we may forget the construction of tensor products, and only remember its properties and universal properties. But I keep in mind that in some cases(maybe in many cases) \(M\otimes N\) refers to that straightforward and beautiful construction of tensor product, 
                and in this way, we may be able to define an bifunctor for the category of all \(A\)-modules. Let's verify that it is really a bifunctor.
            </p>

            <p>
                To verify, we have to define how the tensor \(\otimes\) acts on pairs of morphisms: for \(h:M\rightarrow M'\), \(i:N\rightarrow N'\), we have a bilinear map \(M\times N\rightarrow M'\otimes N'\), \((x,y)\mapsto h(x)\otimes i(y)\). Apply the universal property, we define \(h\otimes i\) to be the unique map 
                \(M\otimes N\rightarrow M'\otimes N'\). Then it is not hard to verify such \(\otimes\) is really a bifunctor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, to prove that the category of all \(A\)-modules is a monoidal category with \(\otimes\), we have to to construct \(\alpha\), \(\lambda\), \(\rho\) and \(e\). But these natural isomorphisms are defined in the most obvious way. Take \(\alpha\) as example. For three \(A\)-modules \(X\), \(Y\) and \(Z\), there 
                exists a unique \(A\)-isomorphism from \(X\otimes(Y\otimes Z)\) to \((X\otimes Y)\otimes Z\) satisfying \(x\otimes(y\otimes z)\) is mapped to \((x\otimes y)\otimes z\). This can be proved by applying the universal property of \(\otimes\) several times. I will omit the details here, but simply illustrate the ideas:
                from \(Y\times Z\), and a fixed \(x\in X\), we define \(f_x(y,z)=(x\otimes y)\otimes z\), which is obviously \(A\)-bilinear, then we ungrade to \(X\times(Y\otimes Z)\). Now we show that those \(f_x\) together fit very well with each other, such that we have another \(A\)-bilinear map: we can prove this using the 
                uniqueness... Anyway this will lead us to the unique isomorphism. I think the details can be checked easily. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As for \(e\), it's simply the trivial abelian group 0, which is also a \(A\)-module...
            </p>

            <p>
                We may conclude here that the tensor \(\otimes\) being a monoidal operator is quite straightforward, but it does not mean that all things together are trivial. I guess things will be dirty if we consider various particular examples. Anyway, we accomplished our goal at the beginning of the post, so we can end here. 
                By the way, congratulate to myself that I pass the defence, although it is a bit discouraging... Never mind, I can overcome this tiny stuff. See you!
            </p>

            <p>
                Edit on 2024-06-13: I realize (actually after searching on google) that the category of \(A\)-modules and the like are actually abelian categories, which means that the hom-sets in these categories has addictional structures such as addition. My goal is to study abelian category in detail from now on, and will write 
                several posts on it. Have a nice day!
            </p>
