            <p>Today is Sunday, and I am about to finish my bachelor's thesis. In my opinion, it is a simple and boring project, and I have no interest in writing it. But I have to.</p>
            <p>I decided to start this blog when I was reading Maclane's book, and I thought maybe I can wrtie blogs everyday, writing about some details of my studying. For example, I can write a post on the basics of monoidal categories. Making it online is convenient for myself, since I can constantly check the contents via the internet. It would also be good for my friend who want to read something I wrote.</p>
