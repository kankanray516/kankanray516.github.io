                Well, what can I say, I am going back to school tomorrow, and there is a bunch of horrible things waiting for me. I had a nightmare a couple of days ago. In the dream, I was abroad, in the new school, and I met a lot of new people. Surprisingly, some of them 
                knew me and said hello to me as if I were a celebrity. But in fact, I was extremly nervous because I understood that my foundation was weak, and I believed that I was not ready or suitable for the new school, new program. I was not belong to that place, where all 
                other students seemed so happy and confident. Then I wake up and realized that it was a dream, and soon I understood that it's not just a dream. In fact, it is quite true. I do believe I am not ready, I am not suitable, and I am too weak, lack of confidence. If 
                I think about it seriously, then I find there are two main reasons for that. First is my limited English level. I still only know the simple words, and do not have any essential progress after the Toefl exam. I am too lazy to improve my English. So now I decide 
                to work harder and pay realistic efforts into it. I will start reading the vocabulary book I bought last year, by using my spare time effetively. My second weakness is lack of aim, I am quite aimless. I do not know why I choose to keep learning. If my mentor asks 
                me about this, how could I answer him? I still do not know. Everytime I thought about this, I feel nervous and anxious. It makes me in a hurry to learn as many new theories as possible, which will lead me to playinhg computer games eventually. What a shame!
            </p>

            <p>
                Every time I experience pressure, I lose my interest. So I doubt that I have no real interest in learning at all. It's just another way of killing time. But if that's true, it would be too cruel to me, and I do not hope that other people would just me like this. 
                I want to improve it. I believe it is crucial for me to learn how to live with negative emotions. I have to lie to myself that I really love learning new theories and I am extremely curious about them. I will try my best to learn them, to increase my knowledge and 
                understandings, which will eventually lean me to a place where I can pretend to be an expert. Sounds great, and I am quite satisfied with those bullshit sentences. Bye!
